Polymers are inherently scratch-sensitive due to their soft nature. Utilizing patterned surfaces while retaining transparency is a viable strategy for better scratch performance. In this paper, we model the scratch behavior of micro-patterned surfaces using FEM simulation by employing a powerful coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The effect of two different pattern types on scratch behavior is studied and validated with available experimental results. Results suggest the significance of patterned surface topology in improving scratch performance.

## Materials & Experimental Scratch Testing
The model system was a polycarbonate film imprinted with two micro-patterns: 1) holes and 2) pillars of equivalent dimensions and distribution. Scratch tests were carried out according to ASTM D7027-13 / ISO 19252:08, with a vacuum fixture and PC backing used to fix the film samples during testing.

Simulations indicate that COF reduction should be more pronounced in pillar structures than in holes; however, pillars shear off under low loads, negating their initial advantage. The combined effects of COF reduction and the air cushion phenomenon make holes particularly effective for scratch resistance, and optimizing this effect by designing smaller holes is a promising future research direction.
