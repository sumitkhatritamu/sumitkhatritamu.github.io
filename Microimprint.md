Surface texturing is extensively used as a cost-effective solution to enhance the scratch visibility performance of polymer products while maintaining their appeal. Textures on surfaces reduce the effective contact area, resulting in lower surface friction compared to flat surfaces. Low surface friction is crucial for improving polymer scratch performance. Unlike flat sample scratches, scratches on textured surfaces are discontinuous, especially at lower loads. This characteristic aids in hiding scratch markings through visual masking, where regions of high contrast and shadow mask the initial discontinuous scratch. Gao et al defined these features as bruise spots observed at lower loads, followed by creeping scratches and pattern damage at higher loads in constant load scratch analysis.

I model the scratch behavior of textured surfaces using FEM simulation by employing coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The effect of various texture types on scratch behavior is studied and validated with available experimental results.

The FEM scatch generation takes into account the material constitutive model, surface properties, and accurate surface topology to create a realistic scratch.

Once the scratch is generated by employing FEM modeling, it is fed to the virtual black box to do scratch visibility analysis as shown below.  
<br> <br>
A polymer sample's overall scratch performance involves a combination of scratch deformation resistance and visibility to the human eye. The effects of surface texture, optical properties like color and gloss, and the impact of lighting and viewing angles are often limited to costly experimental observations.

Experimentally addressing scratch visibility has been effectively done through various standardized methods. One commonly used method involves an enclosed chamber (black box) with a light source having rotational freedom around a platform for the scratched sample. A top-fixed digital camera serves as the viewing device, while psychophysical tests can be concurrently conducted by trained individuals standing at a prescribed distance and observing the scratched surface at different orientations of the light source relative to the scratched sample. This setup offers comprehensive coverage of lighting orientation and viewing angles along one axis.

The primary challenge in scratch visibility studies lies in the multidisciplinary nature of surface appearance research, encompassing physical properties and psychophysics. To study scratch visibility it is essential to understand how humans perceive and interact with various surface attributes and environments. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 2006 report on visual appearance defines it as "A visual sensation through which an object is perceived to have attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, gloss, transparency, opacity, etc.". Among these attributes, color, texture, gloss, and translucency are the major optical parameters defining appearance.

## Textured Sample
For a textured sample, in addition to the points above, capturing accurate surface topology in terms of grain size and shape is most important.

The use of BRDFs to replicate surface appearance is a popular technique in optics, human vision, and psychology. Pardo et al. conducted psychophysical tests with seven evaluation criteria for various artworks, including color, shading, texture, clarity, geometry, chromatic aberration, and pixelation. The findings showed a high level of visual fidelity in 3-D rendered images compared to real-world counterparts, scoring nearly 4 out of 5 on a perceptual scale. Moreover, the results revealed a strong correlation between perceived realism and faithfulness in reproducing geometry, shading, color, and material texture of the artwork replicas.

To address the fundamental issue mentioned above, we've introduced a virtual reality simulation of scratch visibility using a physics-based BRDF and 3-D rendering. The implementation leverages the BRDF provided by Blender software for physics-based rendering. 3-D rendering has been successfully applied in literature for studying visual appearance alongside psychophysical tests. Honson et al. successfully explored the impact of shape, roughness, and gloss on the perceived reflectance of color, while Isherwood et al. investigated the influence of 3-D shape and gloss on color saturation and lightness.

<br> <br>
The physics-based rendering can replicate the appearance factors like surface roughness, gloss, color, and lighting with high fidelity. Utilizing this information we have successfully utilized commercially available BRDFs to simulate scratch visibility. We were able to not only combine the experimentally obtained scratch characteristics on 3D scanned scratches but also were able to expand it to Finite Element Method generated scratches. This enables us to create a virtual cycle of design-development-analysis-optimization of scratch performance in flat and textured polymers.

Results show the significance of textured surface topology in improving scratch performance and the effect of textures in masking scratch. FEM-generated scratches correlate well with the experimental results in terms of scratch performance improvement achieved with respect to the flat sample.

The virtual scratch peformance analysis, once validated gives the freedom to do parameteric study in term of not only consitutitve parameters but texture grain geometeric parameteres. For example, the animations below shows the FEA simualtion of paramateric analysis in terms of texture grain height (2 * reference) and size (0.5 * reference) where refence grain is the texture above which is already validated with experimental data.

Once the FEA scratch is generated then the scratch masking perfomance of textures can be visualized with the help of virtual reality setup.
